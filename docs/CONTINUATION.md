# Repository refactor continuation log

Last updated: 2026-08-05 (Asia/Saigon)

## Active optimization checkpoint

- Current sign-off checkpoint: strict-PE0 timing isolation.
- Correctness: 348 PASS, 0 FAIL over cases 0 through 7 (K=2/4/8/16).
- Aggregate cycles: 1789828, up 18096 (1.02%) from tagged LDLT border
  streaming in exchange for timing margin.
- Timing: WNS +0.168 ns, TNS 0, zero failing endpoints at 100 MHz.
- Resources: 119105 LUT, 53653 FF, 24 RAMB36, 71 DSP48.
- Detailed report:
  `reports/releases/TIMING_ISOLATION_SIGNOFF_20260805.md`.
- Compact cycle data:
  `reports/releases/timing_isolation_k_sweep_20260805.csv`.
- Architecture: residual operands are registered before PE0 and then flow
  PE0 -> PE1 -> PE2 -> PE3; no downstream row has direct controller ingress.

The next checkpoint should reduce the LDLT border scoreboard/cache footprint
without losing positive WNS.  Prefer per-row banking and removal of resets from
valid-protected data storage before attempting double-buffered preload.  Any
resource change must repeat the full correctness, per-algorithm cycle, resource,
and WNS report.

## Previous optimization checkpoint

- Branch: `codex/strict-pe0-timing`
- Latest pushed checkpoint: `cfedb27` (tagged LDLT border stream).
- Correctness: 348 PASS, 0 FAIL over cases 0 through 7 (K=2/4/8/16).
- Aggregate cycles: 1771732, down 132562 (6.96%) from the preceding
  factor-check-clean checkpoint and down 197447 (10.03%) from strict P0.
- Timing: WNS +0.018 ns, TNS 0, zero failing endpoints at 100 MHz.
- Resources: 118199 LUT, 53554 FF, 24 RAMB36, 71 DSP48.
- Detailed report:
  `reports/releases/LDLT_BORDER_STREAM_SIGNOFF_20260804.md`.
- Compact cycle data:
  `reports/releases/ldlt_border_stream_k_sweep_20260804.csv`.

Completed checkpoints on this branch are strict PE0 ingress/timing closure,
residual block-8 chaining, exact factor-check early rejection/dead-path
cleanup, and multi-transaction LDLT border streaming.  Correlation/vector
update fusion for IHT/GP and exact four-row top-K remain intact.  A replicated
eight-lane top-K eligibility mask was tested and rejected because it increased
area; it is not in source.

Strict PE0 provenance and positive WNS remain release gates.  The current
WNS margin is only +0.018 ns, so the next implementation should first reduce
LDLT scoreboard/cache routing or add a timing-isolation stage, accepting a
small cycle increase if needed.  Do not add another large datapath until that
margin is improved.

QR has been evaluated only as an optional robustness fallback and is not in
RTL.  The study and entry criteria are in
`reports/releases/QR_ROBUSTNESS_STUDY_20260804.md`.

### Residual chaining update

- Tagged residual block-8 chaining is signed off after the P0 checkpoint.
- Full K-sweep: 348 PASS, 0 FAIL.
- Aggregate cycles: 1904934, down 64245 (3.26%) from strict P0.
- Timing/resources: WNS +0.249 ns, 105383 LUT, 39884 FF, 24 RAMB36,
  71 DSP48.
- Detailed report: `reports/releases/RESIDUAL_CHAIN_SIGNOFF_20260804.md`.
- Next implementation target: multiple in-flight tagged LDLT border
  transactions, then exact top-K/factor-check cost reduction. (Completed;
  retained here as historical checkpoint context.)

## Checkpoint

- Working branch: `codex/clean-repository-layout`
- Pre-refactor tag: `pre-repo-layout-741c0f2`
- Baseline commit: `741c0f2b5a01f8e3da6b2765170f2e7870d8cd79`
- Refactor type: repository layout and tooling only; no RTL logic edits

## Completed

- Split synthesizable RTL into independent `rtl/v1` and `rtl/v2` trees.
- Organized RTL by control, datapath, interconnect, memory, PE, solver, and top.
- Compared every moved RTL file against the baseline Git blob: zero byte
  mismatches.
- Moved testbenches/golden vectors to `verification/v1` and `verification/v2`.
- Moved bare-metal C sources to `sw/v1` and `sw/v2`.
- Moved golden models to `models/golden`.
- Moved reviewed project results to `reports/v1` and `reports/v2`.
- Moved historical experiments to `research`.
- Isolated old scripts under `scripts/legacy`.
- Added canonical simulation and synthesis entrypoint `scripts/run.ps1`.
- Added version configs and RTL manifests.
- Separated generated work and raw logs into ignored `work/` and `logs/`.
- Moved local pre-refactor generated trees to
  `work/legacy_pre_refactor`; nothing was deleted.
- PowerShell parser: zero errors in active scripts.
- Layout/path validation: PASS.
- Active source/manifests contain no hard-coded `D:/vivado_pj` or stale
  `CSCGRA.srcs/sources` path.
- RTL audit: v2 has zero uninstantiated internal modules. V1 reports the
  historical standalone `pe_tile` definition as uninstantiated.

## Completed dynamic smoke test

Command:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File .\scripts\run.ps1 `
  -Flow sim -RtlVersion v2 -Cases 0 -RunId layout-smoke-v2
```

Result:

- M=64, N=256, K=16
- 33 PASS, 0 FAIL
- OMP: 110785 cycles
- IHT: 105466 cycles
- HTP: 173848 cycles
- GP: 106282 cycles
- GOMP: 60894 cycles
- MP: 60145 cycles
- CoSaMP/SP skip behavior unchanged because the case requires 2K candidate
  support.
- Raw log:
  `logs/sim/v2/layout-smoke-v2/case0_all.log`
- Raw log SHA256:
  `3A05D6B9EF7ECB214C6F4428680DB0500EB573ADE072655E3ECEA7FFC8C9F047`

The raw log is intentionally ignored; this file preserves the sign-off
summary.

## Completion update: 2026-08-03

The remaining sign-off work is complete:

- RTL v1 full regression: 348 PASS, 0 FAIL.
- RTL v2 full regression: 348 PASS, 0 FAIL.
- V1 comparison with `clean_check_run1_k_sweep_by_case`: 62/62 result rows
  and 2/2 skip rows match exactly.
- V2 comparison with `refactor_case0_v2/full_sweep.log`: 62/62 result rows
  and 2/2 skip rows match exactly.
- Compared fields: M, N, K, algorithm, iteration, cycle, status, PC, and NZ.
- V1 OOC synthesis: WNS +3.487 ns, data path 6.503 ns; resource totals match
  the pre-refactor `synth_incr_cgra_top` report exactly.
- V2 OOC synthesis: WNS +3.001 ns, data path 6.989 ns; resource totals match
  the factor-reuse baseline exactly.
- Both synthesis runs completed with 0 errors and 0 critical warnings.

Vivado 2018.1 compatibility was added to the canonical OOC runner by setting
the fileset `include_dirs` property before `read_verilog`. The first attempt
using the newer `read_verilog -include_dirs` option stopped before reading RTL
and was replaced by a successful clean retry.

Detailed final results are in
`reports/releases/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT_SIGNOFF_20260803.md`. No correctness,
cycle, timing, or resource work remains for the layout refactor.

## Optimization continuation baseline

The consolidated performance data, implemented optimization inventory,
strict-PE0 architecture gap, rejected trials, and ordered next-work backlog are
recorded in `reports/releases/OPTIMIZATION_BASELINE_20260803.md`. The complete
configured v1/v2 cycle matrix is also available as
`reports/releases/optimization_baseline_k_sweep_20260803.csv`.
